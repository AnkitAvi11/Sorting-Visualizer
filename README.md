#   Sorting Visualizer
Thanks to Clement who inspired me to do this sorting visualizer using React. I never thought I would be able to achieve this. At first I always find it intimidating and overwhelming at the same time. But when I started doing I found it somewhat easy to do. Thank you so much Clement for being the inspiration behind. If i hadn't been for you I would have never been able to do it.

### Coming to application
This application has the following sorting algorithms implemented  
-   Bubble Sort


More to come soon
